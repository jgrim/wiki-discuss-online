# Why we say “blaster”

To get straight to the point: **the word “gun” can create dangerous misunderstandings.**

Saying “gun” where anyone in the general public can overhear is dangerous for the same reason as walking around with a camo-painted Longshot: someone may think that there’s a firearms-related threat. What’s obviously a blaster to a hobbyist is not obvious to Joe Public, and a frightened Joe Public will be far more likely to call the police than to look closer and see their mistake. 

Saying “gun” is an easy mistake to make; for many people it’s a habit. It’s a habit that we encourage (and remind and remind and remind) people to break. 

This matters when speaking online as well as IRL, because:

* Words are habits. Some people benefit from practicing using one word over another by consistently saying that word. Even if *you* can easily use different words in different contexts, you’re setting an example. We have young users. This is especially important for us since our tagging-sport hobby uniquely often takes place in otherwise crowded public spaces (parks, schools, etc.).

* The use of the word online isn’t necessarily safe either - e.g. Facebook’s automated moderation can react badly to it. 

This not merely hypothetical. This has resulted in a number of games being canceled, at least one B/S/T facebook group being closed, and general grief to players and public. 

There’s no good reason not to say “blaster.” Both words are technically correct, and if you are concerned for technical correctness you’ll probably like the fact that “blaster” is more specific. Likewise “bullet,” while probably less dangerous than “gun,” is still dangerous in addition to being technically wrong. 

This whole cavalcade of headaches can be avoided by just using a different word. So, let’s do that.

Here is a simple list of examples and news items where outsiders to the hobby reacted badly on mishearing players:

Here's a few more examples that pertain more to the risk of blasters being visually mistaken for guns rather then the word 'gun,’ but which still serve to illustrate the point that blasters and weapons should stay clearly distinct:
